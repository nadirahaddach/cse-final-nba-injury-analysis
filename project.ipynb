    "# Breaking Point: Analyzing the Effect of Injuries on NBA Team Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "*This project explores how player injuries impace NBA team performance from 2000-2023. Using multiple datasets, including injury reports, team stats, and season outcomes, we analyze correlations between win-loss ratios. We also investigate whether teams with deeper benches generate better outcomes after key player injuries and wether injuery-prone teams struggle to advance in the playoffs.*"
