    "# Breaking Point: Analyzing the Effect of Injuries on NBA Team Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "We have always been facinated by the unperdictable nature of sports, how even a championship level team can unravel due to a single injury. That lead us to explore how injury trends in the NBA affect team performance. Using multiple datasets with decades of inputs, this project investigates the correlations between win-loss ratios, postseason sucess, and strength of schedule with injuries. Through this analysis, we hope to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do injury counts per season correlate with a team's win to loss ratio in the NBA?\n",
    "- Do teams with fewer injuries consistently rank higher in their conferences or make deeper playoff runs?\n",
    "- Do teams with stronger strength of schedule suffer more injuries throughout the season?"

    "## Implications and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The strongest beneficiaries of this analysis would be NBA front offices and coaching stadd, the analysis highlights relashionships between injuries and overall team success. These insights can be a valuble tool in where to allocate reasources, for example load managemnet, training staff, or bench depth. Also, NBA fans could benifit from this analysis, especially sports betters, allowing them to better understand how injuries can affect win percentage and playoff success. \n",
    "\n",
    "One group that could be exluded or harmed by this data are players. With more injury prone players could lose contracts or lose favor in public perception for \"bringing down their team\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Three limitations of this analysis are inconsistent injury reporting, difference in injury severity, and the fact that injuries are only a fragment of a teams overall success. To start, our data doesn't cover seaons before 2000, and even after that, many teams could under report injuries due to less rigorous documentation. As a result, it's unclear how accurate early data is. Aditionally, our data doesn't take into account the severity of injuries and doesn't differentiate between starters and bench players. A star would likley have a much bigger impact on a team if hurt than a bench player, but this analysis does not account for this. Lastly, injury is just a small piece of a team, other factors, like roster quality, coaching, etc. are not taken into account.\n",
